                <h2>About Madi.</h2>
                <p>I have no idea how I decided what to take in post-secondary. By the end of university, I didn’t have any more clarity on what I could do with the skills I now had. I know I wasn’t alone.</p>
                <p>3 years and 6 jobs later, I think I got a hang of how to find a purposeful role and I’m excited to share with other young professionals that have found themselves uncertain in their next career step or in a role that they feel unfulfilled in.</p> 
                <p>During my day job, I connect folks who made a career change to jobs in tech. Outside of work, I’ve been sharing my lessons and strategies to building a career path you love. Through individualized sessions, I want to help you define your story, embrace your transferable skills, and get a job you don’t hate.</p> 
                <p>Outside of work, I’m an organizational behaviour enthusiast, bridge builder, volunteer, and cat mom.</p>

                        <p>In our quick 30 minute session I learned so much from Madi! She is extremely knowledgeable and easy to converse with. She had many helpful suggestions for my resume including small changes that I feel will allow me to stand out.  She answered all my questions and I now feel very confident with my resume!</p>

                        <p>Hi Madi! I just wanna say thank you again for the resume review. Having done so much volunteering while in my undergrad, it was great to hear that those positions are equally as important to my paid work and should still be highlighted!! I also loved that Plum website to see what skills I could highlight throughout my resume! Thank you so much!</p>

                        <p>Like many others, I found myself laid off due to COVID-19. I took this as an opportunity to switch industries entirely. With Madi's attention to detail and great advice, I was able to take my resume to the next level. I recommend her resume review for anyone currently in their job search.</p>
