                        <p>I have no idea how I decided what to take in post-secondary. By the end of university, I didn’t have any more clarity on what I could do with the skills I now had. I know I wasn’t alone.</p>
                        <p>3 years and 6 jobs later, I think I got a hang of how to find a purposeful role and I’m excited to share with other young professionals that have found themselves uncertain in their next career step or in a role that they feel unfulfilled in.</p> 
                        <p>During my day job, I connect folks who made a career change to jobs in tech. Outside of work, I’ve been sharing my lessons and strategies to building a career path you love. Through individualized sessions, I want to help you define your story, embrace your transferable skills, and get a job you don’t hate.</p> 
                        <p>Outside of work, I’m an organizational behaviour enthusiast, bridge builder, volunteer, and cat mom.</p>
